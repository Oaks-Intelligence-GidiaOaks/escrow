          <h5 className="pb-3">
            Welcome to Escrow-Tech Ltd Business Solutions, a suite of optional
            seller services.
          </h5>
          <p>
            THIS AGREEMENT CONTAINS THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS THAT GOVERN YOUR
            ACCESS TO AND USE OF THE SERVICES THROUGH A PARTICULAR ACCOUNT OR
            ACCOUNTS AND IS AN AGREEMENT BETWEEN YOU OR THE BUSINESS YOU
            REPRESENT ("YOU") AND ESCROW-TECH LTD (THE "AGREEMENT"), THE OWNER
            AND OPERATOR OF CARBON-ADJUST.COM, (THE "AGREEMENT"). BY REGISTERING
            FOR OR USING THE SERVICES, YOU (ON BEHALF OF YOURSELF OR THE
            BUSINESS YOU REPRESENT) AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS
            AGREEMENT, INCLUDING THE SERVICE TERMS AND PROGRAMME POLICIES FOR
            EACH SERVICE YOU REGISTER FOR OR USE IN CONNECTION WITH
            CARBON-ADJUST.
          </p>
          <p>
            As used in this Agreement, "we," "us," "Escrow-Tech" and in some
            circumstances “Carbon-Adjust”, means Escrow-Tech Ltd named in the
            applicable Service Terms and "you" means the applicant (if
            registering for or using a Service as an individual), or the
            business the applicant is employed by or represents (if registering
            for or using a Service as a business). Capitalized terms have the
            meanings listed in the Definitions below. If there is any conflict
            between these General Terms and the applicable Service Terms and
            Programme Policies, the General Terms will govern and the applicable
            Service Terms will prevail over the Programme Policies.
          </p>
          <li>1. Enrolment</li>
          <p>
            To begin the enrolment process, you must complete the registration
            process for one or more of the Services. By registering for or using
            the Services you confirm that you did not rely on any oral or
            written representations made by employees of Escrow-Tech and/or any
            of its affiliates and that you chose the service based on your own
            due diligence and consideration. Use of the Services is limited to
            parties that can lawfully enter into and form contracts under
            applicable law (for example, children may not sign up to use
            Carbon-Adjust). As part of the application, you must provide us with
            your (or your business’) legal name, Primary Place of Business
            address, phone number and e-mail address, as well as any other
            information we may request. Any personal data you provide to us will
            be handled in accordance with Esrcow Tech’s Privacy Notice.
          </p>
          <li>2. Service Fee Payments</li>
          <p>
            Fee details are described fully in the applicable Service Terms and
            Programme Policies. You are responsible for all of your expenses in
            connection with this Agreement, unless this Agreement or the
            applicable Service Terms provide otherwise. To use a Service, you
            may be required to provide Escrow-Tech Ltd with valid credit card
            information from a credit card or credit cards accepted by
            Escrow-Tech (“Your Credit Card”). You will use only a name you are
            authorized to use in connection with a Service and will update all
            of the preceding information as necessary to ensure that it at all
            times remains accurate and complete. You authorize Escrow-Tech (and
            will provide us documentation evidencing your authorization upon our
            request) to verify your information (including any updated
            information), and to charge Your Credit Card or debit any of your
            payment account(s) held with Escrow-Tech Ltd, where applicable, for
            any sums payable by you on Carbon (in reimbursement or otherwise).
            If you registered for Selling on Carbon-Adjust, all payments to you
            in relation to the Carbon-Adjust Site will be made in accordance
            with the User Agreement. In addition to charging payable sums to
            Your Credit Card, you authorize Escrow-Tech to choose instead to
            either (a) offset any amounts that are payable by you to us (in
            reimbursement or otherwise) against any payments we may make to you,
            or (b) invoice you for amounts due to us, in which case you will pay
            the invoiced amounts upon receipt. Except as provided otherwise, all
            amounts contemplated in this Agreement will be expressed and
            displayed in the Local Currency, and all payments contemplated by
            this Agreement will be made in the Local Currency.
          </p>
          <li>3. Term and Termination</li>
          <p>
            The term of this Agreement will start on the date of your completed
            registration for use of a Selling Service and continue until
            terminated by us or you as provided below. You may at any time
            terminate your use of any Selling Service immediately on notice to
            us via email, the Contact Us Form, or similar means. We may
            terminate your use of any Services or terminate this Agreement for
            convenience with 30 days’ advance notice. We may suspend or
            terminate your use of any Services immediately if we determine that
            (a) you have materially breached the Agreement and failed to cure
            within 7 days of a cure notice unless your breach exposes us to
            liability towards a third party, in which case we are entitled to
            reduce, or waive, the aforementioned cure period at our reasonable
            discretion; (b) your account has been, or our controls identify that
            it may be used for deceptive or fraudulent or illegal activity; or
            (c) your use of the Services has harmed or our controls identify
            that it might harm other sellers, customers, or Escrow-Tech’s
            legitimate interest. We will promptly notify you of any such
            termination or suspension via email or similar means sent to you
            individually, indicating the reason and any options to appeal,
            except where we have reason to believe that providing this
            information will hinder the investigation or prevention of
            deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity, or will enable you to
            circumvent our safeguards. Any suspension will last until you have
            provided satisfactory evidence that you have cured its cause and
            implemented the necessary changes except in case of suspension based
            under (b) or (c) above where we terminate or may not reinstate in
            light of the initially deceptive, fraudulent or illegal activity or
            harm. On termination of this Agreement, all related rights and
            obligations under this Agreement immediately terminate, except that
            (e) you will remain responsible for performing all of your
            obligations in connection with transactions entered into before
            termination and for any liabilities that accrued before or as a
            result of termination, and (f) Sections 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11,
            15 and 17 of these General Terms survive.
          </p>
          <li>4. Licence</li>
          <p>
            You grant us a royalty-free, non-exclusive, worldwide, right and
            licence for the duration of your original and derivative
            intellectual property rights to use, any and all of Your Materials
            for the Services or other Escrow-Tech product or service; provided,
            however, that we will not alter any of Your Trademarks from the form
            provided by you (except to re-size trademarks to the extent
            necessary for presentation, so long as the relative proportions of
            such trademarks remain the same) and will comply with your removal
            requests as to specific uses of Your Materials; provided further,
            however, that nothing in this Agreement will prevent or impair our
            right to use Your Materials without your consent to the extent that
            such use is allowable without a licence from you or your affiliates
            under applicable law (e.g., fair use under copyright law,
            referential use under trademark law, or valid licence from a third
            party).
          </p>
          <li>Representations</li>
          <p>
            Each party represents and warrants that: (a) if it is a business, it
            is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the
            laws of the United Kingdom; (b) it has all requisite right, power
            and authority to enter into this Agreement and perform its
            obligations and grant the rights, licences and authorizations its
            grants hereunder; (c) any information provided or made available by
            one party to the other party or its affiliates is accurate and
            complete, and it will promptly update such information as necessary
            to ensure it at all times remains accurate and complete, (d) it is
            not subject to sanctions or otherwise designated on any list of
            prohibited or restricted parties or owned or controlled by such a
            party, including but not limited to the lists maintained by the
            United Nations Security Council, the US Government (e.g., the US
            Department of Treasury’s Specially Designated Nationals list and
            Foreign Sanctions Evaders list and the US Department of Commerce’s
            Entity List), the European Union or its member states, or other
            applicable government authority and (e) it will comply with all
            applicable Laws in performance of its obligations and exercise of
            its rights under this Agreement.
          </p>
          <li>Indemnification</li>
          <p>
            6.1 Your indemnification obligations. You will defend, indemnify,
            and hold harmless Escrow-Tech, and our officers, directors,
            employees, and agents, against any third-party claim, loss, damage,
            settlement, cost, expense, or other liability (including, without
            limitation, attorneys’ fees) (each, a “Claim”) arising from or
            related to (a) your non-compliance with applicable laws; (b) Your
            Products, including the offer, sale, refund, cancellation, return,
            or adjustments thereof, and any personal injury, death (to the
            extent the injury or death is not caused by Escrow-Tech), or
            property damage related thereto; (c) Your Taxes and duties or the
            collection, payment, or failure to collect or pay Your Taxes or
            duties, or the failure to meet tax registration obligations or
            duties; or (d) actual or, based on specific indications, alleged
            breach of any representations you have made.
          </p>
          <p>
            6.2 Escrow-Tech’s indemnification obligations. Escrow-Tech will
            defend, indemnify, and hold harmless you and your officers,
            directors, employees, and agents against any third-party Claim
            arising from or related to: (a) Escrow-Tech’s non-compliance with
            applicable laws; or (b) allegations that the operation of a
            Carbon-Adjust store infringes or misappropriates that third party’s
            intellectual property rights.
          </p>
          <p>
            6.3 Process. If any indemnified Claim might adversely affect us, we
            may, to the extent permitted by applicable law, voluntarily
            intervene in the proceedings at our expense. No party may consent to
            the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement of an
            indemnified Claim without the prior written consent of the other
            party, which may not be unreasonably withheld; except that a party
            may settle any claim that is exclusively directed at and exclusively
            affects that party.
          </p>
          <li>7. Limitation of Liability</li>
          <p>
            Both parties are only liable for damages suffered as a result of
            willful misconduct or gross negligence. In case of minor negligence,
            the parties are only liable for (a) injury to life, body, or health;
            or (b) foreseeable typically occurring damages resulting from the
            breach of a fundamental contractual obligation.
          </p>
          <li>8. Insurance</li>
          <p>
            If the gross proceeds from sales of Your products processed through
            Carbon-Adjust exceeds the applicable Insurance Threshold during each
            month over any period of three (3) consecutive months, or otherwise
            if requested by us, then within thirty (30) days thereafter, you
            will maintain at your expense throughout the remainder of the Term
            public third party liability insurance in connection with
            Carbon-Adjust with at least the Insurance Limits per
            occurrence/aggregate covering liabilities caused by or occurring in
            conjunction with the operation of your business in connection with
            Carbon-Adjust, including products liability and bodily injury, with
            policy (ies) naming Escrow-Tech and its assignees as additional
            insureds. At our request, you will provide to us certificates of
            insurance evidencing the coverage required by this Section 8.
          </p>
          <li>Tax Matters</li>
          <p>
            As between the parties, you will be responsible for the collection,
            reporting, and payment of any and all of Your Taxes, except to the
            extent that (i) Escrow-Tech automatically calculates, collects, or
            remits taxes on your behalf according to applicable law. You agree
            to and will comply with the tax policies listed under any Programme
            Policies. All fees and payments payable by you to Escrow-Tech under
            this Agreement or the applicable Service Terms are exclusive of any
            applicable taxes, deductions or withholding (including but not
            limited to cross-border withholding taxes), and you will be
            responsible for paying Escrow-Tech any of Your Taxes imposed on such
            fees and any deduction or withholding required on any payment.
          </p>
          <p>
            You agree to accept electronic invoices from Escrow-Tech in a format
            and method of delivery as determined by us.
          </p>
          <li>10. Self-billing </li>
          <p>
            In the event that we purchase any of Your Products, you agree that
            Escrow-Tech may issue self-billed invoices on your behalf for the
            period from the date on which you have agreed to allow Escrow-Tech
            to buy Your Products until the date on which this Agreement is
            terminated by us or you. Self-billed invoices will contain any
            information that we determine is required to issue a VAT-compliant
            invoice under the applicable Law. Escrow-Tech may retain this
            information and use it as required by Law. You must notify us
            immediately if you (i) are aware of any additional information that
            needs to be provided to the self-billed invoices to comply with the
            applicable Law, (ii) cease to be registered for VAT, or (iii) change
            your VAT registration number. Self-billed invoices will be issued in
            the currency of Carbon-Adjust. Each self-billed invoice will be
            considered accepted if you do not reject it within 30 days from the
            date of issue. You agree to not raise separate sales invoices for
            the transactions covered by a self-billed invoice.
          </p>
          <li>11. Confidentiality and Personal Data</li>
          <p>
            11.1 During the course of your use of the Services, you may receive
            Confidential Information. You agree that for the term of the
            Agreement and 5 years after termination: (a) all Confidential
            Information will remain Escrow-Tech’s exclusive property except for
            customer personal data; (b) you and your affiliates will use
            Confidential Information only as is strictly necessary for your
            participation in the Services; (c) you will not, and will cause your
            affiliates not to, directly or indirectly (including through a third
            party) otherwise disclose Confidential Information to any
            individual, company, or other third party except as required to
            comply with applicable law; and (d) you will take all reasonable
            measures to protect the Confidential Information against any use or
            disclosure that is not expressly permitted in this Agreement; and
            (e) you will retain Confidential Information only for so long as its
            use is strictly necessary for participation in the Services or to
            fulfill your statutory obligations (e.g. tax) and in all cases will
            delete such information upon termination or as soon as no longer
            required for the fulfilment of statutory obligations. The foregoing
            sentence does not restrict your right to share Confidential
            Information with a governmental entity that has jurisdiction over
            you, provided that you limit the disclosure to the minimum necessary
            and explicitly indicate the confidential nature of the shared
            information to the governmental entity. You may not issue any press
            release related to the Services, or use our name, trademarks or logo
            in any way (including in promotional material) without our advance
            written permission, or misrepresent or embellish the relationship
            between us in any way. You may not use our name, trademarks, or
            logos in any way (including in promotional material) not covered by
            a Trademark Usage Guidelines published by us, or by our advance
            written permission.
          </p>
          <p>
            11.2 Unless specified in a Programme Policy, we act as an
            independent or joint controller of any customer personal data
            collected via the Services, depending on the purpose for the
            collection of the data. Unless specified in a Programme Policy, you
            are independent controllers of the customer personal data (including
            contact information) that you process to fulfill orders, provide
            associated services to customers, or comply with applicable law, and
            you shall only process customer personal data for the specific
            purposes above.
          </p>
          <p>
            11.3 Notwithstanding any additional obligations contained in this
            Agreement, or applicable Acceptable Use Policy, or Privacy Policy,
            when processing customer personal data, you must: (a) comply with
            your obligations under applicable data protection law; (b) keep
            customer personal data confidential at all time (the above 5 years’
            term limit does not apply to customer personal data); (c) implement
            and maintain physical, technical and organizational measures to
            protect customer personal data against any personal data breach
            which are commensurate with the nature of personal data; (d) notify
            us without undue delay after becoming aware of a personal data
            breach and take appropriate measures to address the personal data
            breach, including the remediation efforts necessary to rectify and
            prevent a recurrence of the breach; (e) provide us prompt assistance
            as we may reasonably request to meet our obligations under
            applicable data protection law; and (f) be responsible for providing
            notice to data subjects in respect of the customer personal data
            (where required under applicable data protection law) and responding
            to data subject requests in accordance with applicable data
            protection law.
          </p>
          <p>
            11.4 For the purpose of this Section 11, "Restricted Transfer" shall
            mean the transfer of customer personal data from the United Kingdom
            (UK) to another country or from the European Economic Area (EEA) to
            another jurisdiction outside of the EEA and such a transfer is not
            on the basis of an adequacy decision. To the extent that we transfer
            any customer personal data to you and such transfer constitutes a
            Restricted Transfer, then you and we acknowledge and agree that such
            a transfer, with you as the data importer and us as data exporter,
            will be subject to the EU Standard Contractual Clauses set forth in
            the Programme Policies and where the processing of the customer
            personal data is subject to the applicable data protection law in
            the UK. You shall not make a Restricted Transfer unless such
            transfer is subject to a lawful transfer mechanism.
          </p>
          <li>12. Force Majeure. </li>
          <p>
            We will not be liable for any delay or failure to perform any of our
            obligations under this Agreement by reasons, events or other matters
